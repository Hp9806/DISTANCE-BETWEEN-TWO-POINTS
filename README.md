# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
 Read the given matrix
### Step 2: 
taking values from the matrix
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
PRINT THE RESULT
### PROGRAM:

import numpy as np
p1=[10,6]
p2=[4,2]
distance=np.sqrt(((p1[0]-p2[0])*(p1[0]-p2[0]))+((p1[1]-p2[1])*(p1[1]-p2[1])))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
  ~~~


### OUTPUT:
